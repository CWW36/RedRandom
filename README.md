# RedRandom5
Plays Pokemon Red Randomly in BizHawk Emulator. At least my 5th attempt.

## Requirements
- Pokemon Red ROM
- Bizhawk Emulator 2.6.1 (No guarantee it will work on previous or subsequent versions of Bizhawk, or any other emulator.)
- Windows, probably (I don't think Lua Console is available on the Mac version of Bizhawk, though I'm not sure.)

## Instructions
### Downloading
1. You should have downloaded all the requirements, as well as the files in this git.
2. Put the files in this git somewhere in the Bizhawk folder (I use "\Lua", the Lua folder)
3. Create a folder called "Savestates" in that folder (So that's "\Lua\Savestates" for me).
### Running
4. Edit the editable variables in RedRandom5.LUA
5. Open Tools -> TASStudio and close it. (This is necessary, until [this Bizhawk issue is resolved](https://github.com/TASVideos/BizHawk/issues/2525).)
6. Open Tools -> Lua Console.
7. In the Lua Console window, go to Script -> Open Script
8. The program will now play Pokemon Red Randomly!
